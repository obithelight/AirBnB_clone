# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
- Python, OOP

- This project is an AirBnB clone built in `Python`, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The purpose of this project is to create a simplified version of the AirBnB platform, focusing on the backend functionality including managing users, places, amenities, and bookings.

### Command Interpreter:

- The command interpreter serves as the primary interface for interacting with the AirBnB clone. It allows users to perform various operations such as `creating`, `updating`, `deleting`, and `displaying objects` in the system. The interpreter follows a command-line interface (CLI) approach, enabling users to input commands and receive feedback accordingly.

### How to Start:

To start the AirBnB clone console, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone <repository-url>
- Navigate to the project directory: cd <project-directory>
- Run the console script: ./console.py

### How to Use:

- Once the console is running, users can input commands following the specified syntax. Each command consists of a command keyword followed by arguments if necessary. Here are some examples of supported commands:

- create <class-name>: Creates a new instance of the specified class.
- show <class-name> <object-id>: Displays information about a specific instance.
- update <class-name> <object-id> <attribute-name> "<new-value>": Updates the attributes of a specific instance.
- destroy <class-name> <object-id>: Deletes a specific instance from the system.
- all <optional-class-name>: Lists all instances of a particular class or all classes if no class name is provided.
- quit or EOF: Exits the console.
